cqlsh
=====

`cqlsh` is a Python-based command-line client for running simple CQL commands on a Cassandra cluster.  This script and the associated libraries come bundled with Apache's Cassandra installer.  This repo is a re-bundled version that allows for `cqlsh` to be used on a separate machine or in a virtual environment.

Documentation is available in the [Apache Cassandra(TM) 2.0 documentation](http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/webhelp/index.html#cassandra/gettingStartedCassandraIntro.html).
